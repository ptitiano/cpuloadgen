			it has been replaced by a better system and you

	   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	   F:	drivers/net/	all files in and below drivers/net
	   F:	drivers/net/*	all files in drivers/net, but not below

	   F:	net/
	   X:	net/ipv6/
	   matches all files in and below net excluding net/ipv6/
	K: Keyword perl extended regex pattern to match content in a
	   patch or file.  For instance:

	      matches patches or files that contain one or more of the words
	      printk, pr_info or pr_err

order.
